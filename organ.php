							<p>There are over 30 professional organizations in the field of social work. They range from very large organizations like the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), which has over 150,000 members, to smaller more niche organizations like the National Organization of Forensic Social Work (NOFSW). There are also social work organizations that focus on specific ethnic groups, like the Hispanic or African American communities, or have religious affiliations.</p>
							<p>While every social work organization is different, organizations provide their members with a variety of resources that could include: professional development, continuing education, certifications, annual conferences and events, newsletters and journals, social networking, job boards, research, and more. In addition, many social work organizations act as an advocacy group on behalf of their members in order to promote their profession at the local, state and national levels.</p>

    <p>A human resources department is a critical component of employee well-being in any business, no matter how small. HR responsibilities include payroll, benefits, hiring, firing, and keeping up to date with state and federal tax laws.</p>
	<p>Any mix-up concerning these issues can cause major legal problems for your business, as well as major employee dissatisfaction. But small businesses often don't have the staff or the budget to properly handle the nitty-gritty details of HR. Because of this, more and more small businesses are beginning to outsource their HR needs.</p>

<p>HR outsourcing services generally fall into four categories: PEOs, BPOs, ASPs or e-services. The terms are used loosely, so a big tip is to know exactly what the outsourcing firm you're investigating offers, especially when it comes to employee liability.</p>

								<h3>PSYCHIATRIC DEPARTMENT</h3>
								<p>Business Psychology is an applied science that investigates how to make people and organisations more effective.

    <p>Business Psychology is an applied science that investigates how to make people and organisations more effective.  It uses social scientific research methods to study people, workplaces and organisations in order to better align their multiple and sometimes competing needs. Its goal is to create healthy, productive and mutually beneficial relationships between people and organisations..</p>
	<p>As an applied science, Business Psychology can inform organisations about what constitutes effective organisational practice. It has a reciprocal relationship with business, drawing insights from those with experience of what works at work to enable psychological research to be applied pragmatically in ways that are appropriate to the situation. It also allows a cross fertilisation of experience: from business into psychology, and of academic knowledge and rigour from psychology into business.</p>
	<p>Business Psychology employs a wide range of research methods to investigate and identify best organisational practice. It combines qualitative and quantitative methods, and considers both types of evidence equally legitimate. Common data collection methods include questionnaires, surveys, focus groups, interviews and case studies. Common analytical techniques include descriptive and inferential statistics, thematic and content analysis.</p>

								<h3>GOVERMENTAL COMPANY</h3>
								<p>Government Company is a company or an organization in which at least 51% of the paid up share capital is held by the central government or the state government or partly by both central and state government.

	<p>A government-owned corporation is a legal entity that undertakes commercial activities on behalf of an owner government. Their legal status varies from being a part of government to stock companies with a state as a regular stockholder.</p>
	<p>There is no standard definition of a government-owned corporation (GOC) or state-owned enterprise (SOE), although the two terms can be used interchangeably. The defining characteristics are that they have a distinct legal form and that they are established to operate in commercial affairs. While they may also have public policy objectives, GOCs should be differentiated from other forms of government agencies or state entities established to pursue purely non-financial objectives.</p>

								<h3>NON GOVERMENTAL COMPANY</h3>
								<p>Non Governmental organizations, or NGOs, were first called such in Article 71 in the Charter of the newly formed United Nations in 1945. While NGOs have no fixed or formal definition, they are generally defined as nonprofit entities independent of governmental influence (although they may receive government funding).</p>

    <p>Non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, were first called such in Article 71 in the Charter of the newly formed United Nations in 1945. While NGOs have no fixed or formal definition, they are generally defined as nonprofit entities independent of governmental influence (although they may receive government funding).</p>
	<p>As one can tell from the basic definition above, the difference between nonprofit organizations (NPOs) and NGOs is slim. However, the term "NGO" is not typically applied to U.S.-based nonprofit organizations. Generally, the NGO label is given to organizations operating on an international level although some countries classify their own civil society groups as NGOs.</p>
	<p>NGO activities include, but are not limited to, environmental, social, advocacy and human rights work. They can work to promote social or political change on a broad scale or very locally. NGOs play a critical part in developing society, improving communities, and promoting citizen participation.</p>
